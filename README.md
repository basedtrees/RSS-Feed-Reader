 # About
 
-This is repository hosts the UI and content of an RSS feed reader.
+This repository hosts the UI and content of an RSS feed reader. The
+generated site is published via GitHub Pages at
+https://basedtrees.github.io/RSS-Feed-Reader/, where you can browse the
+latest aggregated articles. After the scheduled build workflow finishes,
+the raw cache that external tools can consume is published alongside the
+site at https://basedtrees.github.io/RSS-Feed-Reader/cache.json.

+## Build & deployment notes
+
+- The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/update-feed.yaml`
+  installs dependencies, runs `npm run build`, and deploys the contents
+  of the `public/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch. Make sure that
+  branch is selected as the GitHub Pages source so the live site reflects
+  the generated cache.
+- `osmosfeed.yaml` intentionally leaves `cacheUrl` unset so the CLI falls
+  back to an empty cache instead of trying to download the previously
+  published JSON. That prevents `npm run build` from aborting with HTTP
+  403 errors on networks that block access to
+  `https://basedtrees.github.io/RSS-Feed-Reader/cache.json`.
+- The build still needs outbound access to the RSS sources listed in the
+  config. If those requests are blocked locally, rely on the GitHub
+  Actions workflow (which runs on GitHubâ€™s infrastructure) to refresh the
+  live cache and site content.
